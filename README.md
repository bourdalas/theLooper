# theLooper
This is The Looper design and implementation repository. TheLooper is a standalone audio-processing device using:

1. A custom sturdy aluminum and wooden case.
2. custom midi input hardware modules  
3. One arduino-mega for mapping this midi input 
4. One rasberry-pi for audio processing (JUCE C++) and other functonalies 



This repo should contain:

1. Case Construction: 
	1. Design files.
	2. Implementation details.

2. Hardware midi i/o:  
	1. modules schematics 
	2. pcb design cad files  
	3. implementation details.

3. Arduino Code: 
	1. for controlling the hardware midi input

4. JUCE Code: 
	1. for controlling the looper audio engine and rasberry functionalities


Now contains:

1. Case Construction:
-

2. Hardware midi i/o:  
-

3. Arduino Code: 
-

4. JUCE Code: 
- HelloLooper: A ready github repo, which a simple looper juce app is implemented. This repo could be used as the core of the looper audio engine
